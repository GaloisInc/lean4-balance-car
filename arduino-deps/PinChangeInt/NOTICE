   PinChangeInt Arduino Library
   Copyright 2008 Chris J. Kiick

   Copyright 2010-2014 Michael Schwager (aka "GreyGnome")

   This product includes software developed by Chris J. Kiick, Lex Talionis,
   and Mike Schwager (aka, 'GreyGnome').

   This library was inspired by and derived from Chris J. Kiick's PCInt Arduino
   Playground example here: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Main/PcInt

   Lex Talionis picked it up, refined it, and created a Google Code page for
   it, found here: http://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/

   GreyGnome is the current maintainer, and would like to thank all those
   Open Source coders, the Arduino makers and community, and especially Chris
   and Lex for lighting the flame and showing the way! And a big thank you to
   the users who have contributed comments and bug fixes along the way.
   Without you this project would not have overcome some significant hurdles.
   A more complete list can be found in the README file.

   A HUGE thanks to Jan Baeyens ("jantje"), who has graciously DONATED an
   Arduino Mega ADK board to the PinChangeInt project!!! Wow, thanks Jan!
   This makes the 2560-based Arduino Mega a first class supported platform-
   I will be able to test it and verify that it works.
